The entries for the free software contest were a bit disappointing. Only 14 entries. I guess you all have MSDN accounts!

Out of those entries, only _one_ added a backlink to the site. His username is **Akbar**. By default, he gets first choice at what he wants. The challenge is that he lives in India, so I'm working with him to see if there is a way to get it to him. If that doesn't work out, I'll choose someone else randomly.

Choosing the second winner was a little harder. I had to come up with a way to generate a random number between 1 and 14 (the number of entries). [Random.org](http://www.random.org/integers/) to the rescue. I used their site to generate a table of random numbers. To make it even more random, I decided to use the 8th value in the first column of values (100 numbers were generated). I figured if the previous winner or a trackback was chosen, I would generate another set.

So the winner with second choice for the software is....

Entry #5, which is &quot;**Federiko**&quot;.

Congratulations to both of you!
