        <h2>TrendWeight</h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://trendweight.com">TrendWeight</a> is a web site that pulls data from Withings or FitBit
            WiFi-enabled scales and runs it through a series of analyses and then plots a moving average (try the demo)
            so
            that the user can see how their weight over time is trending instead of worrying about the day to day ups
            and
            downs that are the natural result of water retention fluxuation.</p>

        <p> It started as a tool that I made just for
            me to use myself, but when I mentioned it to a couple other people on
            a weight loss forum, they asked if they could use it and eventually I polished it into a free tool that
            anyone
            can use. TrendWeight as also an excuse for me to play with Windows Azure (it runs as a Windows Azure Web
            Role
            and uses SQL Azure for data storage).

    <div class="project-description">
        <h2>P2Pool.info</h2>

        <p>In 2011, I got sucked into the world of <a href="http://bitcoin.org">Bitcoin</a>. In particular, I became
            involved with a pool (called P2Pool) with a relatively unique approach, in that the pool was entirely
            distributed. Other pools generally have some centralized server with a back end database that everyone in
            the community talks to.</p>

        <p> As a general rule, these centralized pools, usually have nice looking websites that provide some amount of
            transparency for the community members so that they can see what the current status is and how much is being
            earned by each community member. P2Pool, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t have this. It is a completely
            decentralized pool where all of the community members connect using a peer to peer protocol (hence the
            name). Lots of information about what is going with the pool was available, but only in the log files
            generated on each node of the peer to peer network.</p>

        <p>I wanted a website that people could go to to more easily see what was going on, and so I created <a
                href="http://p2pool.info">p2pool.info</a>. </p>

    <div class="project-description">
        <h2>Bitcoin Command Center</h2>

        <p>To help me keep track of my bitcoin mining, I created Bitcoin Command Center. This web-based application acts
            as centralized dashboard and pulls information about all of my mining devices into an easy-to-consume
            display. It also acts as a web-based frontend to my Bitcoin wallet allowing me to see my incoming
            transactions, to manage my bitcoin addresses, and to send bitcoins to others.</p>

        <p>Technology wise, it is a relatively simple (in the grand scheme of things) single page application and was my
            first adventure into the worlds of
            <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>, and <a
                    href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>. Read more about Bitcoin
            Command Center in one of the two blog posts I wrote on it. The <a
                    href="/2013/09/24/bitcoin-command-a-mining-slash-wallet-management-web-app/">first</a> is an
            overview. The <a href="/2013/09/24/bitcoin-command-fun-with-angularjs/">second</a> is on the underlying
            technology.
