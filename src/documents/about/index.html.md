I'm Jason Young, husband, father, software engineer, and technical evangelist.

Here is me sitting in front of my [Macintosh Plus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Plus). A glorius machine with 1 MB of RAM, and used 800 KB floppy disks and no hard drive.

I've been using computers since they used [beeping cassette tapes for storage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Datasette). Professionally, I started working with ASP.NET while 1.0 was still in beta. Since then, I've written software at companies like [GE](http://www.ge.com/), [Skyline Technologies](http://www.skylinetechnologies.com/), [Orion Energy Systems](http://www.oesx.com/), and [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/). My brain is written in C#, I speak Node.js, and I believe the universe runs on Windows Azure.
