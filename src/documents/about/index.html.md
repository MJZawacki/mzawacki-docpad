I'm Jason Young, software developer at heart, technical evangelist by day.

I started working with ASP.NET while 1.0 was still in beta. Ever since, I've been hooked! Since then, I've written software at companies like [GE](http://www.ge.com/), [Skyline Technologies](http://www.skylinetechnologies.com/), [Orion Energy Systems](http://www.oesx.com/), and [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/). My brain is written in C#, I speak Node.js, and I believe the universe runs on Windows Azure.
