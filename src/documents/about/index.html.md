I am a technology evangelist at Microsoft in our Developer Experience group and my team works with the developer community of Microsoft's largest global partners. Considering my background in Aerospace Engineering and ten years developing software at [Siemens PLM](http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com), I still have a strong desire to develop software for engineers and manufacturers. Luckily, I get to work with many of the same software vendors in the industry through my work at Microsoft.

I love using new technology to improve the experience and productivity of the end user in their lives and work. Enterprise software has for so long been fixed on functionality over efficient user experiences so it's an exciting time to be working in the industry as consumer expectations for "sexy" software UI has bled over into the Enterprise market.

When I'm not working I spend time with my family as well as playing the piano and guitar. During the winter you'll find me at Snoqualmie Pass as a volunteer ski instructor for [Outdoors for All](http://www.outdoorsforall.org).
