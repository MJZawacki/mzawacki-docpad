Just a quick note that I am adjusting some of the TrendWeight server settings.  As a result, you may get an SSL error from your browser saying that the name of ther server does not match the name of the web site.  Example error dialog boxes are below (these are only a couple examples, your specific browser may look different).  This is a benign error and should be resolved soon.  You can safely ignore these errors.

I'll post again when things are back to normal.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

The SSL certificate issues seem to have been resolved.  Everything is working again.  Note, I reserve the right to screw it up again as I keep tinkering :)
