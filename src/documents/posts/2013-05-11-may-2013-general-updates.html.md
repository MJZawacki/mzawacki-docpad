It's been a while since I posted about TrendWeight and wanted to give you a quick update of what's been happening and what's on my todo list...

It's been a busy winter with my primary focus, outside of my day job, has been on staying healthy.  As such, I haven't gotten much done with TrendWeight in a few months.  That said, I am probably going to spend a little time doing some work on it in the next month or two and here's what's on tap:

## Arrows for Lean Mass

Right now, the arrow shown when you are _gaining_ lean mass is red and the arrow for _losing_ lean mass is green.  This is backwards of what most people expect, so I'll be flipping the color scheme when in lean mass mode.

## Data Export

I'll be adding a way to download your data from TrendWeight as a [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file that can be opened in Excel or any other spreadsheet to do your own analysis or to make your own charts.  

Actually, this functionality is already there, but not publicized.  If you visit <https://trendweight.com/export/> you'll get a CSV version of your TrendWeight data including Scale and Trend values for total weight as well as fat %, fat mass, and lean mass.

That said, I'll be adding a button to do this data download to the TrendWeight web site so that it is easier to find in the future.

## Account Management

Finally, I'll be adding a couple minor features: a way to change your email address and a way to completely delete your account if don't want it anymore.  Mostly I am adding these features to reduce the time I spend manually doing these things when people email me asking for help.

## Then What?

Well, I'm not sure.  There certainly have been many suggestions.  Some are significant changes (or additions) to the site.  Others are probably doable in a single weekend.  But before I decide what I want to do next, I thought it would be interesting to get your feedback.  To that end, I created a UserVoice site for TrendWeight where you can add your own suggestions and vote on suggestions that others have already made:

<http://support.trendweight.com>

I pre-populated the site with most of the suggestions I have received by email over the past few months, but feel free to add your own if you have an idea that is not already there.

Remember that this is a free-time project for me and so I make no promises about when any suggestion from that site will get done.  But when I do have some time to work on TrendWeight, I'd just assume spend time working on the things that users want the most.
